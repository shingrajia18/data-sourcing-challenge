This repository contains the code and files for the Module 6 Challenge of the AI Bootcamp. The goal of this project is to extract data from two different sources, The New York Times API and The Movie Database API, then merge and clean the data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies.

## Background

1. Access the New York Times API
2. Access The Movie Database API
3. Merge and Clean the Data for Export
